# Project Title

All database-related functions are prefixed with "db", e.g., `db_update_user`.

## Getting Started

1. **Run the Server**: Execute `main.py` to start the server. This will automatically initialize the FastAPI application and connect to MongoDB.

2. **Change Server Port**: Modify the `PORT` variable in `config.py` to adjust the server's listening port.
